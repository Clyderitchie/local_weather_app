# local_weather_app

## Built With

-   JavaScript
-   Bootstrap
-   HTML
-   CSS

## Usage

Allows a user to search a city of their choosing and gives them a forcast for that day and a five day forcast as well. The application will also store the users recent searches that they have done.
Once the user has searched a city they will be shown a forcast for that day and informs them of the temp, wind, and humidity of that location. The user will also be shown a five day forcast for that location that will show them the same information as the today forcast as well as the date for that day.

## Contribute

If you would like to make your verison of the application to render new data from the API you will need to create a free profile from the Openweather.org to access their api.
I will provide the link to the website here so you can create your own verison.
